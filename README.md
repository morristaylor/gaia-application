# Northern Oregon Coast Range Hike/Fish Map

#### Goals
* Use Mapbox
* Make something I actually want to use, that doesn't exist, that provides value to others
* Work on project planning, goal setting, and managing project creep
* Get hired

#### The Project
* Build an interactive map of hiking and (potential) fishing locations in the Oregon's Northern Coast Range using Node.js, Mapbox GL, and ES6.

#### Happening now
* Scrape Oregon Hikers for Tillamook and Clatsop trailheads
* Build base map
  * Hikes from Oregon Hikers, Gaia GPS, and Oregon Sierra Club's *50 Hikes in the  Tillamook and Clatsop State Forests*

#### Future features
* Rewrite/refactor, use React
* Popups for additional trailhead info, amenities, etc
* Choropleth or charts from ODFW on fish run totals
* More map interactivity: e.g. filter hikes length
* Public land, boating access, campsites, additional forest data from state
