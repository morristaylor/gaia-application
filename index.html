      <p>
        Hello Tools Team! I was asked to share some work I'm proud of, so I've chosen this project of mine, completed independently after finishing code school in late 2018. I was looking to build something to showcase my new skills and new hobbies, and I settled on building an interactive map of hiking and fishing locations in Oregon's Northern Coast Range using Node.js, Mapbox GL, and ES6, hosted on Netlify. I'm proud of this one because it was the first time I built something of substance, from scratch, no tutorials or guides for handholding, with a handful of achievable, set goals, using modern web technologies. The following is a bit of background on the project and some notes on how it functions. Thanks for looking!
      </p>
      <h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Mapbox</li>

        <li>Work on project planning, goal setting, and managing project creep</li>
        <li>Get hired</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="happening-now">Happening now</h4>

      <p>I'm reading <a title="Upstream Searching for Wild Salmon, from River to Table" href="http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/248166/">Langdon Cook's <em>Upstream</em></a> after a November hike up the Salmon River. I saw dozens of dead salmon
        under the bridge on FS2618 and wanted to know more. I've lived in Oregon for five years and have done plenty of hiking, biking, and skiing, but haven't fished since I left New York. I know how to fish for smallmouth and brownies on the
        Schroon River or largemouth in Brant Lake, but I don't know to fish rivers for west coast salmonids. I've decided to change that and have started studying up, starting with Upstream and the Oregon Sierra Club's <em>50 Hikes in the Tillamook
          &amp; Clatsop State Forests</em>.</p>
      <p>Chapter 5 of <em>Upstream</em> focuses on the conservation work of Guido Rahr and the folks at <a title="Campaigns: Oregon North Coast" href="https://www.wildsalmoncenter.org/campaigns/oregon-north-coast/">Portland's Wild Salmon Center</a>.
        Cook and Rarh fish unnamed rivers and tributaries around Tillamook Bay and talk about the history, ecology, and politics around Oregon's wild salmon and forestlands. I found the chapter revelatory and inspiring. These important, protected
        lands and wild fish are in my backyard and I only know them passing: a hike up King's Mountain above the Wilson, summertime day trips to Netarts, schlepping visiting family and friends over Quartz Creek on US26 on the way to Cannon Beach.
        Time to change that. What better way to learn an area than by mapping it.</p>
      <p>The Columbia River Gorge caught fire in 2017 and a majority of the trails on the Oregon side are still closed. The Northern Coast Range-- which includes the Tillamook and Clatsop State Forests-- is not as well-known or well-mapped as the
        Gorge's trail system but also offers great year-round hiking. Many of these trails aren't easily found online-- at least not in one place. Many trails are abandoned logging roads, some share space with OHV, some aren't considered trails at
        all. State funding issues plague trail and bridge maintenance. In short, it's an overlooked place right in Portland's backyard that could use some attention. Using Gaia's OSM and CalTopo layers, I started mapping out routes, with an initial
        focus on hikes around Tillamook Bay rivers.</p>
      <p>The goal of this project is to gather trailhead, trail, river and fishing information all in one place, making exploration of the Northern Coast Range easier and more attainable. This is now an ongoing project. My main focus the past week
        has been getting a stable base map up, adding in hike data from Gaia and trailhead data from my web scraper scripts, plus learning Mapbox as I go along. I hope to add either a choropleth map or charts with salmon run count data. I'd like to
        explore additional data sources from the state regarding land use. And I'd like to keep building the map up, adding more interactivity and hike and trail information.</p>


        <h4 id="some-code-highlights">Some code highlights</h4>
        <p>This site is being built with ES6 JavaScript, Node.js and various modules, Mapbox GL, HTML5 and CSS3. This static version is hosted on Netlify. I'm using highlight.js for syntax highlighting. I use git/GitHub for version control and the repo is here <a href="https://github.com/morristaylor/nocr-gaia-map">https://github.com/morristaylor/nocr-gaia-map</a>.</p>

        <p>I needed to get trailhead info for the Tillamook Forest/North Coast Range area. I set up this web scraper using request-promise-native and Cheerio. It creates a JSON file containing a list of URLs pulled from Oregon Hikers' Field Guide. Cheerio looks for any link with 'Trailhead' in the title, pushes it to an array, and writes the array to JSON.</p>

        <pre><code>
          const fs = require('fs');
          const request = require('request');
          const rp = require('request-promise-native');
          const cheerio = require('cheerio');

          // Takes Oregon Hikers Coast Range landmarks page, scrapes trailhead-only URLs, saves them to json for getTrailheadInfo script
          function getTrailheadURL() {
            const nocUrl = 'https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Category:Coast_Range'
            rp(nocUrl).then((html) => {
              let trailheadURLs = [];
              const $ = cheerio.load(html);
              Array.from($('a[title~="Trailhead"]')).forEach((trailhead) => {
                trailheadURLs.push('https://www.oregonhikers.org' + trailhead.attribs.href)
              })
              fs.writeFileSync('trailhead-urls.json', JSON.stringify(trailheadURLs));
            })
          }

          getTrailheadURL();
        </code></pre>

        <p>Next up, I take that JSON created above and run it through the following code. First, I wrote a constructor function to build a GeoJSON-compliant object. Next, I read and parse the URL JSON file, then use request-promise-native to make a request to each URL. Cheerio again scrapes the requests for relevant information, assigns them to the appropriate variables, executes the constructor function, and pushes them to an array. Once each URL has been requested, scraped, turned into an object and pushed to an array, the array is turned into JSON and written to a file. This GeoJSON-ready data is used in <a href="https://github.com/morristaylor/nocr-gaia-map/blob/master/map.js">map.js</a>.</p>  

        <pre><code>
          const fs = require('fs');
            const request = require('request');
            const rp = require('request-promise-native');
            const cheerio = require('cheerio');

            // Trailhead object constructor
            function Trailhead(name, url, driveTime, lat, lng) {
              this.type = "Feature",
              this.properties = {},
              this.properties.name = name,
              this.properties.url = url,
              this.properties.driveTime = driveTime
              this.properties.icon = 'triangle',
              this.geometry = {},
              this.geometry.type = "Point",
              this.geometry.coordinates = [lng, lat]
            }

            // Takes trailheads URLs from list made with getTrailheadURL, requests each URL, scrapes data from Oregon Hikers, and builds a new trailhead GeoJSON object
            function getTrailheadInfo() {
              var trailheads = [];
              var urls = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('trailhead-urls.json', 'utf8'));
              urls.forEach((url) => {
                rp(url).then((html) => {
                    const $ = cheerio.load(html);
                    const name = $('#mainContent > h1').text().trim();
                    const lat = parseFloat($('#mw-content-text > ul > li:nth-child(1)').slice(0,1).text().slice(11).trim());
                    const lng = parseFloat($('#mw-content-text > ul > li:nth-child(2)').text().slice(12).trim());
                    const driveTime = $('#mw-content-text > ul > li').slice(4, 5).text().slice(29).trim();
                    let trailhead = new Trailhead(name, url, driveTime, lat, lng);
                    if (trailhead.geometry.coordinates[1] >= 45) {
                      trailheads.push(trailhead);
                    }
                    fs.writeFileSync('trailhead-info.json', JSON.stringify(trailheads));
                  });
              })
            }
